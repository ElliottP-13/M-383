\problem{2} Pg 107 Problem 4

If $A \subseteq B_1 \cup B_2$ where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are disjoint open sets and $A$ is compact, show that $A \cap B_1$ is compact. 

Is the same true if $B_1$ and $B_2$ not disjoint?

\problem{3} Pg 107 Problem 8

If $A$ is compact, show that $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ belong to $A$. 

Give an example of a non-compact set $A$ such that both $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ belong to $A$.
