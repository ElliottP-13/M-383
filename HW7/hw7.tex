\problem{1} 4.1.5 Problem 2

Let $A$ be the set defined by the equations $f_1(x) = 0$, $f_2(x) = 0$, ... $f_n(x) = 0$. Where $f_1, ... f_n$ are continuous functions defined on the whole line. Show that $A$ is closed. Must $A$ be compact? \textit{Hint: } you can use result of 4.1.5 Problem 1 without proof

So if $\mathcal{D}_i$ is the set of $x$ satisfying $f_i(x) = 0$ then $A = \cup_{i = 1}^n \mathcal{D}_i$. We know that $\mathcal{D}_i = f^{-1}(0)$. 
From 4.1.5 Problem 1 we know that a function $f$ is continuous iff the inverse image of every closed set is a closed set. Since $f_i$ is continuous, $\mathcal{D}_i$ must be closed. 
Then $A$ is the finite union of a finite number of closed sets which is closed by Theorem 3.2.3. So then $A$ must be closed.

\problem{2} 4.1.5 Problem 4

Give a definition of $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = y$. Show that this is true iff for every sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of points in the domain of $f$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty$ we have $\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) = y$. \textit{Hint: } For the proof of the 2nd part of the problem, refer to the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.

We define $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = y$ as if $\forall 1/m$ there exists an $n$ such that $\forall x > n$ $|f(x) - y| < 1/m$. 

\begin{proof}

We first prove the forward direction. $P \to Q$

Given that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = y$ exists. We take any sequence of points $x_1, x_2, ...$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty$. We show that this implies $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = y$. By our definition, we know that $\forall 1/m$ there exists an $n$ such that $\forall x > n$ $|f(x) - y| < 1/m$. We also know that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty$. Which means that there are infinitely many terms of $x_n$ satisfying $x_j > n$. So $\lim_{j \to \infty} x_j = \infty \implies \exists k \; s.t. \; \forall j \geq k \; x_j > n \implies |f(x_j) - y| < 1/m \implies \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_j) = y$

We now prove the reverse direction.

Given that for every sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of points in the domain of $f$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty$ we have $\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) = y$. 
We show that $lim_{x \to \infty} = y$. We need to show $\forall 1/m$ there exists an $n$ such that $\forall x > n$ $|f(x) - y| < 1/m$. 
Suppose not, suppose that $\exists 1/m$ st. $\forall n$ $\exists n < z_n \in \mathbb{D}$ st. $|f(z_n) - y| \geq 1/m$. We can construct a sequence of the points $z_n$. By definition, $lim_{n \to \infty} = \infty$. But this sequence of points does not converge to $y$. A contradiction. So for every sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of points in the domain of $f$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \infty$ we have $\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) = y$ $\implies$ $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = y$.
