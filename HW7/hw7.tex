\problem{1} 4.1.5 Problem 2

Let $A$ be the set defined by the equations $f_1(x) = 0$, $f_2(x) = 0$, ... $f_n(x) = 0$. Where $f_1, ... f_n$ are continuous functions defined on the whole line. Show that $A$ is closed. Must $A$ be compact? \textit{Hint: } you can use result of 4.1.5 Problem 1 without proof

So if $\mathcal{D}_i$ is the set of $x$ satisfying $f_i(x) = 0$ then $A = \cup_{i = 1}^n \mathcal{D}_i$. We know that $\mathcal{D}_i = f^{-1}(0)$. 
From 4.1.5 Problem 1 we know that a function $f$ is continuous iff the inverse image of every closed set is a closed set. Since $f_i$ is continuous, $\mathcal{D}_i$ must be closed. 
Then $A$ is the finite union of a finite number of closed sets which is closed by Theorem 3.2.3. So then $A$ must be closed.

\problem{2} 4.1.5 Problem 4

Give a definition of $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = y$. Show that this is true iff for every sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of point in the domain of $f$ such that $\lim_{x\to \infty} x_n = \infty$ we have $\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) = y$. \textit{Hint: } For the proof of the 2nd part of the problem, refer to the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.
