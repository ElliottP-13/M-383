\problem{1} 5.1.3 Problem 1

Show that $f(x) = O(|x - x_0|^2)$ as $x \to x_0$ implies $f(x) = o(x - x_0)$ as $x\to x_0$ but give an example to show the converse is not true.

\problem{2} 5.2.4 Problem 1
Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point in the interior, with $g(a) \neq g(b)$. Prove that there exists a point in $x_0$ in $(a,b)$ such that

$$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \frac{f'(x_0)}{g'(x_0)}$$

This is also called second mean value theorem

\problem{3} 5.2.4 Problem 2

if $f$ is a function satisfying $f(x) - f(y) \leq M|x - y|^\alpha$
for all $x,y$ and some fixed $M$ and $\alpha > 1$, prove that $f$ is constant.
\textit{Hint: what is }$f'$. It is rumored that a graduate student once wrote a whole
thesis on the class of functions satisfying this condition!

\problem{4} 5.2.4 problem 3

Suppose $f$ is defined on $[a,b]$ and g is defined on $[b,c]$ with $f(b) = g(b)$ then define:

$$h(x) = \begin{cases}
f(x) & \text{if } a \leq x \leq b\\
g(x) & \text{if } b \leq x \leq c\\
\end{cases}$$

give an exaple where $f$ and $g$ are differentiable but $h$ is not.
Give a definition of one-sided deriviatives $f'(b)$ $g'(b)$ and show that the equality of these is a necessary and sufficient condition for $h$ to be differntiable. Given that $f,g$are differentiable.
