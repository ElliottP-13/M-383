\large{\textbf{Problem 1}}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Let $f$ be a continuous function defined on an open domain, then it is possible that the inverse image of an open set is not an open set.
	
	False. Otherwise $f$ assumes same value twice, and $f^{-1}$ DNE.
	
	\item If $f$ is a continuous function defined on $[0, 1]$, then it is possible that the image of $f$ is unbounded.
	
	False. Continuous function on compact domain Theorem 4.2.3
	
	\item If $f(x)$ is differentiable on open interval $(a,b)$ then its derivative $f'(x)$ can not have any jump discontinuities on $(a,b)$
	
	True
	
	\item $x - \sin(x) = o (x^2)$ as $x \to 0$
	
	True
	
	\item If $f(x)$ is strictly increasing at $x_0$ and $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$ then $f'(x_0) > 0$.
	
	False

\end{enumerate}

\problem{2}

Show that every infinite compact set has a limit-point. Is the same true for infinite closed
set?

\hrule


\begin{proof}

Suppose not, suppose that an infinite compact set $A$ has no limit points. Then any point $x$ is not a limit point, so $\exists 1/n \sp st. \sp \forall y \in A, \sp y \neq x \sp |y - x| \geq 1/n$. 
Let $a = inf A, \sp b = sup A$. We know $a,b$ must be finite since $A$ is compact and thus bounded (theorem 3.3.1).
Then, the points of $A$ must be separated by at least $1/n$. For any $x \in A$ we know that $a \leq x \leq b$. So there is at most a finite number of values in $A$, a contradiction. So there must be a limit point.
\end{proof}

The same is not true for an infinite closed set. It could contain no limit points and would thus also be closed.





\problem{3}

If $f$ is a continuous function on $\reals$, is it true that $x$ is a limit-point of $x_1, x_2, ...$ implies $f(x)$ is a limit point of $f(x_1), f(x_2), ...$? Prove your conclusion.

\problem{4}

Function $f(x)$ is defined by:
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2 \cos(1/x^2), & x \neq 0\\
0, & x = 0
\end{cases}$$

Show that $f$ is differentiable at all $x \in \reals$. Is $f'(x)$ continuous at $x = 0$? Prove your statement.

\hrule







\problem{5}

Suppose $f(x)$ is continuously differentiable on an interval $(a,b)$. Prove that on any closed subinterval $[c,d]$ of $(a,b)$, the function is uniformly differentiable in the sense that given any $1/m$ there exists $1/n$ (independent of $x_0, x$) such that for all $x, x_0 \in [c,d]$ $|x - x_0| < 1/n$ we have
$$|f(x) - f(x_0) - f'(x_0)(x-x_0) \leq \frac{1}{m} |x - x_0|$$

\textit{Hint: Use mean value theorem on $f(x) - f(x_0)$ and the fact that $f'(x)$ is continuous function on the compact set $[c,d]$}
