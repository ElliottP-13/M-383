\problem{1}
True or false

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The set of $\rationals$ is countable? True
	\item Let $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$ be a sequence of countably many sets, and each $A_i, i = 1,2,3,...$ is countable then their cartesian product $A_1 x \times A_2 \times A_3 \times ...$ i countable.
	\item A Cauchy sequence of positive rational numbers cannot be equivalent to a Cauchy sequence of negative rational numbers.
	
	\item Let $x_1, x_2, ...$ be a convergent squence of real numbers, then $limsup x_n = liminf x_n$.
	
	\item The union of any number of closed sets is a closed set.
\end{enumerate}


\problem{2}
The statement "A real number x is a limit-point of a sequence of real numbers $x_1, x_2, . . .$"
can be written explicitly using quantifiers as follows: "For all $n \in \naturals$, for all $m \in \naturals$, there
exists $j > m$ such that $|x - x_j| < 1/n$". Now write the statement "A real number x is
not a limit-point of a sequence of real numbers $x_1, x_2, ...$" explicitly using quantifiers
\hrule



\problem{3}
Give an example of a set A that is not closed but such that every point of A is a limit point
\hrule




\problem{4}
let $x_1, x_2, ...$ be a sequence of real numbers given by
$$x_n = \frac{\cos(\sqrt{n!}\pi)}{4^n}$$
and define
$$y_n = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$$
prove that the sequence $y_1, y_2, ...$ converges
\hrule





\problem{5}
prove
$$limsup\{x_n + y_n\} \leq limsup\{x_n\} + limsup\{y_n\}$$
if both $limsup\{x_n\}$ and $limsup\{y_n\}$ are finite, and give an example where the equality does not hold.
