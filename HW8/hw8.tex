\problem{1} 4.2.4 Problem 1

If $f$ is monotone increasong on an interval and has a jump discontinuity at $x_0$ in the interior of the domain, show that the jump is bounded above by $f(x_2) - f(x_1)$ for any two points $x_1, x_2$ in the domain surrounding $x_0$: $x_1 < x_0 < x_2$

\hline






\problem{2} 4.2.4 Problem 3

If the domain of a continuous function is an interval, show that the image is an interval. Give examples where the image is an open interval.
\textit{Hint: Consider the interval with end points inf\{f(D)\} and sup\{f(D)\} where f is the function and D is the domain and use the intermediate Value theorem}

\hline






\problem{3} 4.2.4 Problem 9

If $f$ and $g$ are uniformly continuous, show that $f+g$ is uniformly continuous

\hline







\problem{4} 4.2.4 problem 11

If $f$ is a continuous function on a compact set, show that either $f$ has a zero or $f$ is bounded away from zero ($|f(x)| > 1/n$ for all $x$ in domain and some $1/n$)
