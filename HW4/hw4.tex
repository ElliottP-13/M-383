\problem{1} 3.1.3 problem 1a)

Compute the sup, inf limsup, liminf and all the limit points of $x_n = 1 + (-1)^n / n$

\hrule


$x_n = 0, 3/2, 2/3, 5/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 9/8, ...$

Clearly the sup is 3/2 and inf is 0. 
We then show that the sequence is convergent to 1.
We need to show $\forall n \in \naturals \; \exists m \in \naturals \: s.t. \forall j \geq m \; |x_j - 1| \leq 1/n$. 

$$|x_j - 1| = |1 + (-1)^j / j -1| = |(-1)^j/j| = 1/j$$

If we choose $m = n$ then $1/j \leq 1/n \; \forall j \geq n$ as required. Since it is a convergent sequence, by theorem 3.1.5 $limsup = liminf = 1$.

\problem{2} 3.1.3 problem 2

If a bounded sequence is the sum of a monotone increasing and monotone decreasing sequence ($x_n = y_n + z_n$ where $\{y_n\}$ is monotone increasing and $\{z_n\}$ is monotone decreasing) does it follow that the sequence converges? What if $\{y_n\}$ and $\{z_n\}$ are bounded?
